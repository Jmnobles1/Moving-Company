# Moving-Company
a moving company gets pickup locations and pickup sizes of furniture to get and return to a warehouse. 
The max pickup size the truck can store is 1600 and the max miles the truck can move from the warehouse is 10. 
Pickup locations can be up to 2 miles apart  including with floats going north or south from each other (ex. North-5 to 7, or south 5 to 3, etc.)
Once the moving truck has returned to the warehouse 3 times the total storage collected is displayed.
